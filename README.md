## Project Proposal

### Domain of Interest
* Why are you interested in this field/domain?
> We feel that investigating mental health is important because it directly impacts people's lives and has become a growing issue in the U.S. It is also important to acknowledge the effect intersectionality has on an individual's mental health.
* What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?
  * [“Mental Health”](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health) is a data visualization project that focuses on breaking down world data on mental health by disorder, gender, and country. It also explores the link between mental health disorders and suicide, as well as its relationship with factors such as employment status, education level, and life satisfaction.
  * [“OSMI Mental Health Data Visualization”](https://nidhi729.github.io/DataVis-Mental-Health/) is a project that works to demonstrate the prevalence of mental health within the IT industry. Through charts, interactive maps, and more, the project covers data on everything from age range to willingness to discuss mental health disorders with peers.
  * [“Behavioral Health Conditions in the United States”](https://www.recoverymonth.gov/sites/default/files/toolkit/2017-data-visualizations.pdf) is an infographic that educates its audience on the number of Americans that deal with mental health issues relative to the number that get the treatment they need. Likewise, the infographic points out that many depression and substance abuse cases remain untreated in the US.
  * [“GBD Compare”](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/) is an interactive data project that allows the user to compare different disability and mortality rates from diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the world. The data can be filtered by cause, deaths, years lived with disability, age, sex, and more.
* What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?
  * How does mental health effect different demographics of people?
  * Are there any disparities between different groups of people and mental health outcomes (specifically gender and race)?
  * Are there disparities in the type of treatment different groups of people receive?
  * What are the most prevalent mental illnesses in society?
